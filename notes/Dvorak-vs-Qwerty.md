Dvorak v.s. Qwerty
==================


 



* Less Finger Movement
    * Dvorak used 1/3 the finger movement of Qwerty.
    * Dvorak had 20% less of the minimum movement required to type this one question than did Qwerty.
    * The chart below shows that Dvorak used about 61% ( 26661 mm) of the movement to type this letter than Qwerty, at 100% ( 43904 mm ).  This translates to Dvorak at 26661 mm, or 87.54 feet, and Qwerty, at 43904 mm, or 144.15 feet.for a difference of 56.61 feet, less used when using Dvorak.  This figure is when using the 'less experienced' pattern of motion described above, a more efficient, experienced typist might reduce this somewhat, but even as a hypothetical example, half of this would be 28 or so feet, still quite a bit to walk one's fingers, when there is an easier way.  






How The Qwerty To Dvorak Users Say
----------------------------------


- [I've been using the Dvorak layout since about 1993. I taught myself over about a monthâ€”just forced myself to use it. Today, I can switch between QWERTY and Dvorak if I need to (though QWERTY's harder for me now) and I LOVE Dvorak. ][quote-1]

- [Your story sounds a lot like mine. During that transitional period, when I was still terrible at Dvorak, I'd occasionally switch back to Qwerty when I needed to type quickly (say, when chatting with someone). The thing that really made me stick with Dvorak was the clear difference in how my wrists felt: when I was typing with Dvorak, I didn't notice them at all, but when I switched back to Qwerty I could almost immediately feel the stress in them. 14 years later, I'm still glad I made the switch.][quote-1]
